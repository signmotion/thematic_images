Share some ‚ù§Ô∏è and star repo to support the [Thematic Image Generator](https://github.com/signmotion/thematic_images).

_If you write an article about **ThematicImageGenerator** or any of [these](https://pub.dev/packages?q=publisher%3Asyrokomskyi.com&sort=updated) packages, let me know and I'll post the URL of the article in the **README**_ ü§ù

## üöÄ Usage

By default the package uses `https://source.unsplash.com` as source of images.

### Get an image

```dart
// get an image generator
final images = Images(keywords: ['castle']);

// generate an image
final image = await images.next;

// save the generated image as PNG file
const file = 'example_image.png';
final encoder = findEncoderForNamedImage(file)!;
final bytes = encoder.encode(image);
File(file).writeAsBytesSync(bytes);

```

- Refining the code. While I'm aware it's primarily my responsibility to refactor the code, I wholeheartedly welcome any contributions you're willing to make in this area. Your insights and improvements are appreciated!
- Constructive code reviews. Should you discover a more efficient approach to achieve something, I'm all ears. Your suggestions for enhancement are invaluable.

## ‚úÖ TODO (perhaps)

Once you start using the **ThematicImageGenerator**, it will become easy to choose the functionality to contribute. But if you already get everything you need from this package but have some free time, let me write here what I have planned:

- Notes on the image.
- Styles of images.
- Random sizes options.
- Just a one-filled-color image.
- Local images with keywords.

It's just a habit of mine: writing down ideas that come to mind while working on a project. I confess that I rarely return to these notes. But now, hopefully, even if you don't have an idea yet, the above notes will help you choose the suitable "feature" and become a contributor to the open-source community.
